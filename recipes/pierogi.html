    <h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
    <div class="emp"> Pierogi recipe for Polish dumplings has been a family favorite from generation to generation.
        We traditionally make these for Christmas, but they can be made for any special event.
        There's some work involved, but the outcome is rewarding! The boiled pierogies can be fried in butter and onions
        or
        served with sour cream.
